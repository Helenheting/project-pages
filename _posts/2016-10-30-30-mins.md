# Bioinformatics

There is a interesting aritcle in Computational Biology. You can find [here](https://github.com/Helenheting/project-pages/blob/gh-pages/assets/so%20you%20want%20to%20be%20a%20computational%20biologist%3F.pdf)
. It talks about two computational biologists give advice about studying bioinformatics. So what I get from this paper? Here comes some points.

 1. Understand your goals and choose appropriate methods.

Trying to understand the underlying methods and algorithms in the software. It will help you save a lot of time.

 2. Set traps for you own scripts and other people's.

Try and do that for every 'type' of answer you expect to find. And double-check the results of everything.

 3. You're a scientist, not a programmer.

The perfect is the enemy of the good.(Ha, Learn a new saying). Perfectly written, extensively documented, elegant code that gets the answer wrong is not as useful as a basic script that gets it right.

 4. Use version control software

Document your code and scripts so that you understand what they do.

 5. Pipelineitis is a nasty disease

Think before using it:Dose it need to be a pipeline? Have you saved time?Is your pipeline really of use to others? Don't waste your time.

 6. An Obama frame of mind

 Be adventurous, be prepared to fail, but keep going.(really great sentence!) It is amazing what you can achieve by using Google, by asking other people in the field and by teaching yourself how to solve it.

 7. Be suspicious and trust nobody

Treat results with great suspicion, and carry out further tests to determine wether the results can be explained by experimental error or bias.

 8. Be a detective

The data contains a story and it's your job to find out what that story is. Work the data. Figure it out.

 9. Someone has already done this. Find them!

 Two excellent resources:

Hook up with other computational biologists.

# Biology

**Rearrangements power large-scale genomic changes.**

Point mutations can create changes in population of organisms from the same species, but  they lack the power to create  and differentitate entire species. Thisis more arduous work is left to larger mutations called genome rearrangments, which  move around huge blocks of DNA.

Because rearrangement that affect species evolution occur infrequently, two closely related species will have very similar genomes. Thus, to simplify comparsion of two such genomes, reseachers first identify similar intervals of DNA from thee species, called synteny blocks; over time, rearrangement have created these synteny blocks and heaved them around across the two genomes.

A pair of synteny blocks from two different species are not stricty identical, but for the sake of studying large-scale rearrangments, we consider them to be equivalent. As a result, we can label each synteny block with a postive integer, when comparing two species' genomes/chromosomes.
